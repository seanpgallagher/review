# Exercise 2 – Update the navigation

To make it easier to navigate between the various web sites we will add some new entries to your site navigation.

1. After creating a new site, you are presented with the *Next steps* pane, click **X** to close it
2. In the left navigation of your new site, take a look at the quick launch (left menu) at the bottom of the quick launch, click on the **Edit** button  

![A screen shot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-802.png)
3. The quick launch is now in edit mode, hover your mouse cursor beneath a link, for example, *Home* to reveal the **Add a link** button and click on it  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image1068.png)
4. Note that the drop-down at the top of the menu allows you to instantly link to tools in the *Microsoft 365 Group* associated with this site, here leave **Link** selected
5. In the address bar, we will create a link to an external website; you can choose your company’s website if you like or if you want an example try:   
**http://www.combined-knowledge.com** or, enter the web address for your organisation
6. In the Display name field enter a description, for example, your companies name or to continue the example from earlier **On Demand Training**, or enter **My Company** if you added a link to your organisation in step 5
7. Click **OK** to create the link, click on the ellipsis (…) to the right of the new link for management options
8. Use **Move up** or **Move down** to position the link, if it is not under *Home* already, position it under the *Home* link
9. Next choose **Make sub link** to indent the link under the home link
10. At the bottom of the menu, click **Save** and notice that sub-links collapse, consider using sub-links to better structure the quick launch (if you don’t see the drop-down arrow next to the *Home* link try refreshing your browser)

# Exercise 3 – Themes and icons

When your site was created, you may, or may not like the colour scheme. You can change the colour pallet for the site if required. In this exercise, we will be working on the theme of our modern SharePoint site which will allow us to change the colour scheme and alter the sites icon.

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image1069.png)

1. Open a new browser tab and using your preferred search engine, perform an image search for a logo you would like to have as your site icon, the example below if for Google:

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with low confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-803.png)

1. Locate a suitable image and save it to your desktop using the right click menu on the image
2. Return to the tab with your SharePoint site and click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog and click on **Change the look**
3. Click **Theme**, now select a theme, selecting a theme will apply its colours to the site so you can preview it, click **Save**, or choose **Cancel** to keep your original theme
4. Next to apply your icon, in the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) menu, which should be open from earlier, choose **Change the look** then choose **Header**
5. Under the *Site logo* heading choose **Change**  
![A red square with white text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-804.png)
6. Use *File Explorer* to locate the image you saved earlier, select the image, and click **Open**

# Exercise 4 – Delete a site

When a site was created in error or is no longer needed, it can be deleted. We will create a new site and then delete this new site. Recovery of the deleted SharePoint site can be resolved by a SharePoint Online Administrator.

1. In the **app launcher** **![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-2.jpeg)** click on **SharePoint**
2. Next, click on the **+ Create site** button at the top of the site   

![A picture containing graphical user interface  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-13.jpeg)
3. Choose **Team site** then enter a *Site-name* (we recommend entering your first name and Delete for example **Chris-Delete** or **Caroline-Delete**
4. For the *Privacy settings* choose **Private**
5. Click **Next**
6. Click **Finish** to access your new site
7. Let’s acknowledge that this site was created in error and it will not be used, to delete the site, click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog and click on **Site information** then **Delete site**
8. Check over the site deletion statement then, **tick the box** for the statement  
*Yes, delete this group and all its associated resources*  

This means that the associated Microsoft 365 Group such as its mailbox, calendar, and security will be removed, along with its associated Microsoft Team if connected
9. Click on **Delete**
10. Once the site has been deleted, navigate back to your team site, e.g. [Your name] – [Your department] from the SharePoint app (try searching for your site if there is not a shortcut in the SharePoint app)

If you can’t find your site yet, it will eventually appear in the SharePoint app, refresh your browser when you start the next exercise and it should appear

Optional – Configure site regional settings

In your team site e.g. [Your name] – [Your department], click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog at the top right of the page and choose **Site information** then **View all site settings**. Under the heading *Site Administration* select **Regional settings**. Update your *Time zone* and *Locale*to your region. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **OK** and in your quick launch menu, click **Home**.

# Lab 3 – Creating Pages

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-254.png)

In this lab we will practice designing web pages in SharePoint within our team site. We will edit our home page and create buttons to help our team navigate to useful content. We will also showcase key members of staff within your team. Next, we will create a Communication site to promote articles and content from our division. We will then create a new page within our Communication site and add some exciting content around an upcoming event and publish it as a news item.

# Lab 4 – Working with Apps

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-829.png)

Team sites are fantastic locations for collaborating on work, completing tasks, managing processes and planning events. To start managing content in our site, we will begin by setting up a new document library, an ideal location for storing files. We will produce a library that is equipped for storing and managing your teams expense claims. The staff that travel and accumulate personal expenses for their work can claim it back through this library.

Rather than simply allowing the library to become a dumping ground of files, we will implement columns to help quickly identify information. With a selection of columns, you can create views to re-organise the content based on properties found in the columns, for example, filter out expense claims that have been paid.

We will then upload content to the library and populate the columns with metadata to help users quickly find files that have related properties using sorting, filtering, and views. We will also look at setting up an *alert* to notify you if any content has been deleted from this library.

We will also create a new list based on a holiday request process. We will enhance these lists with Power Apps and Power Automate later in the course. We will also delete and restore an app.

5. Make a noticeable change to the file, e.g. delete the chart and change the cell colour  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-846.png)
6. Once you have finished, close the web browser tab that contains the workbook, your changes are automatically saved
7. Right click on the file and choose **Version history**
8. In the version history menu, notice the file size difference between the two most recent versions, hover your mouse cursor over the **Date and Time** stamp of the 2nd most recent version to reveal a drop-down arrow, click on this arrow
9. Choose the option **Restore**  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image1126.png)
10. In the prompt to confirm the recovery of this older version click **OK**
11. The version before you made your modifications is recovered as the current version. However, this does not override the previous version which can still be accessed
12. Click on the **X** at the top right of the version history window to close the menu
13. Click on the file name once more, and in the new web browser tab you should see a preview of the current version of the file which does not feature the previous versions changes

# Exercise 8 – Delete and restore an app

Lastly in this lab we will review the steps for removing and recovering an app in a site.

1. In the Quick Launch click on **Expenses**
2. At the top of the screen click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog and choose **Library settings** then choose **More library settings**
3. Under the heading, *Permissions and Management* click on **Delete this document library**
4. Click **OK** to confirm
5. To recover a deleted app, in the Quick Launch, click on **Recycle Bin**
6. Place a tick next to the **Expenses** library
7. Click on **Restore** in the ribbon
8. Click on **Site contents** in the Quick Launch
9. Notice that the Expenses library has returned. However, there is no link for it in the Quick Launch anymore; recovered apps are not placed back in this menu

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-852.png)  

1. If you have some time, using what you already know about the edit options for the quick launch, try recreating the Expenses link and try making some of your new apps appear as sub-links so that the navigation appears a little tidier

# Lab 5 – Using Power Automate and Power Apps

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-853.png)

As part of Microsoft 365, Power Automate and Power Apps offer connectivity to services like SharePoint, Dynamics CRM, OneDrive and more as well as external services too. Power Automate is a workflow builder, a way of automating common processes like gathering feedback, approving files and moving information. Typical processes such as the signing of an expense claim can automatically deliver the tasks to the right audiences and keep the stakeholders informed.

Power Apps offers site owners the option to design new forms to capture information for their lists. They can be accessed using web parts on your site pages however, you can also access these forms on your mobile phone as Power Apps is available from your device’s marketplace or app store.

In this lab, we will be enhancing a basic SharePoint list, created in the previous exercise. The holiday requests list allows staff to document their annual leave.

To automate this process, we will have a workflow automatically start when a request is submitted to alert the line manager of the new holiday request and request an approval. 

To help end users’ complete requests from SharePoint and their mobile phone we will use a Power App to design a more intuitive form. This can involve helpful logic to avoid common mistakes that are made when making a holiday request. It will also allow us to implement some light branding on the form too.

# Exercise 4 – [Optional] Power Apps mobile

In this exercise you can choose whether you would like to test the solution we have created on a mobile device.

1. Dependent on your mobile phone, navigate to your marketplace or app store
2. Search for **Power Apps** and download the app
3. Once the app has downloaded, open it, using your Microsoft 365 email address and password from this course
4. By default, your apps are displayed, select the **New Holiday Request** tab (note that if other students are on your course you may see their apps, so look for the one with your name as the publisher)
5. Create a new request using the form
6. Refreshing your list in SharePoint, you will see the request submitted from your phone
7. If an approver of the workflow has their Microsoft 365 mailbox mapped to an app on their phone, approvals can also be completed from a mobile device
8. You may delete the app from your mobile phone

# Lab 6 – Customising Security

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-642.png)

As your site grows and more content is created, the importance of ensuring the information reaches the right audience becomes the next stage in our sites story. Typically, very few people will have access to the site. As time goes on, changes will happen to the site and its members that may require a shift in the way users access information.

A new site owner should check their sites publicity and its sharing settings. This will allow you to control if people can automatically join your site, and how much of the site they are allowed to share. More restrictive sites can allow access requests, we will configure this option to allow those who do not have access to our site the option to request access from our site owners.

Next we will look at sharing the site. You can either just share your site, or if you are using a Team site with a Microsoft 365 group, you can choose to share your site and associated shared mailbox, group calendar and Team if present. In this exercise we will define reasons for whether we will need to add someone at the site or group level. 

Lastly we will look at rights around apps, folders and files. In SharePoint you can be both permissive and restrictive in access for containers within a site. Much of these customisations can be managed within the modern SharePoint interface, however, for certain actions we will require the use of the classic interface.

# Exercise 1 – Modify site sharing preferences

Each site can be configured to allow flexibility in how audiences can be added to a site and what they can share. We will firstly check to see what our site privacy is set to, before making changes to how users share and request access to the site.

1. In your team site e.g. [Your name] – [Your department], click on the **Settings** ![Single gear outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-877.png) cog at the top-right of the page and choose **Site information**
2. Under privacy settings click on the drop down menu to review the options  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-878.png)
3. Note that public sites permit anyone in your organisation to join this site as a member and its contents are visible to everyone, private sites and its content are only visible to those who already have access
4. Ensure **Private** is selected and choose **Save**
5. Because our site is private, for those who do not have access to the site but find their way to it via links, we can configure access requests, to do this click on the **Settings** ![Single gear outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-877.png) cog at the top-right of the page and choose **Site permissions**
6. Under the heading *Site Sharing* click on **Change how members can share**![A hand cursor pointing to a white sign  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-879.png)
7. Under the heading *Access requests* note that *Allow access requests* is enabled, if you wished to turn off this feature, this would be where to do it, notice too that site owners will be emailed if someone requires access to the site (this can be changed to a mailbox)  

![A screenshot of a phone  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-880.png)
8. Under the heading *Add a custom message to the request access page* enter the following message:  

If you require access to this site, please note that any request will be peer reviewed and this can take up to 5 working days. If your request is urgent, please call Ext: 455.
9. Before we save the new message, let’s scroll up and look at the *Sharing permissions* menu, currently owners and members can share the site, files and folders, the setting can be lowered to disallow members from sharing the site but allow files and folders or only allow owners to share the site, files and folders; choose **Site owners and members, and people with Edit permissions can share files and folders, but only site owners can share the site**![A screenshot of a document  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-881.png)
10. At the bottom of the menu click **Save** to apply all of the changes

# Exercise 2 – Managing Microsoft 365 Groups

SharePoint Team sites favour being managed by Microsoft 365 Groups. This is due to the team site template being the backbone of the Microsoft 365 Groups object, for example when a Team is created in Microsoft Teams, a Microsoft 365 Group is created. The SharePoint site, within the group, is used in the background to store the Teams files. Hence SharePoint teams sites is integral to Microsoft 365 groups. Some site templates do not use Microsoft 365 groups like the Communication site template. Instead these use the older SharePoint groups which we will look at later (as they are still present in Team sites but are not commonly used).

1. We need to add more users to collaborate in our site, the *Permissions* pane should still be open from the previous exercise, otherwise click on the **Settings** ![Single gear outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-877.png) cog at the top-right of the page and choose **Site permissions**

1. Click on the **Add members** button
2. Note there are two options here, as a team site we can leverage the Microsoft 365 group or stick to the native classic SharePoint security, because we want these additions to have access to not just the site but the other services in the Microsoft 365 group like the shared calendar and mailbox, we will choose **Add members to group**

3. Click **Add members**
4. Enter the following names: Caroline Lee and Rav Sandhu
5. To change the level of access given to Rav, click on **Member** below Rav’s name and choose **Owner**  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-883.png)
6. Once ready click **Save**
7. Note that when viewing the *Add members* pane, you can easily update access, update *Steve Smith’s* access from **Member** to **Owner**
8. Access can be revoked here too, below *Caroline Lee’s* name, click **Member** and choose **Remove from group**  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-884.png)
9. Click on the **X** to close the *Group membership pane*

# Exercise 3 – Managing SharePoint Groups

When working in Microsoft 365 Groups, you might find that some audiences may not need access to all of the resources in a group. Elements of a Microsoft 365 Group like the mailbox, calendar, team (if present) may not be something you wish to share with some colleagues due to the nature of the information being discussed. To share only the site, and not the other services tied to a Microsoft 365 Group, you can use the same interface we just used to share the site.

1. The *Settings* pane should still be open from the previous exercise, otherwise click on the **Settings** ![Single gear outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-877.png) cog at the top-right of the page
2. Next choose **Site permissions**
3. Click on the **Add members** button
4. Select the **Share site only** button  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-885.png)
5. We removed Caroline Lee earlier who previously had access to the Microsoft 365 Group, lets add her once more to this site, type **Caroline Lee** into the search box and select the result
6. Also add **Simon Gray** another user we wish to share the site with
7. Make both Caroline and Simon visitors by selecting their level of access **Edit** and adjusting it to **Read**
8. Untick the option **Send email**
9. Lastly click **Add**  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-886.png)
10. Now that both Caroline and Simon have access to just the site, and not the other services in the Microsoft 365 Group, Caroline reports that she needs to be able to work on documents within the site, expand the group called **Site visitors – no control**![A black and white text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-887.png)
11. Click on the **Read** drop down below *Caroline Lee* then choose **Edit**  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-888.png)
12. Although Caroline disappears from the site visitors group, you can expand the **Site members – limited control** to note that Caroline is now in this group  

![A group of circles with text and a yellow arrow  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-889.png)
13. Note that there is an additional group in Site members called *[Site name] Members*, these are the users that you have made Members of your Microsoft 365 Group, their access can collectively be increased to Owner or decreased to Read but it is very uncommon to do this as it would negatively impact collaboration  

![A screenshot of a website  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-890.png)
14. Click on the **X** at the top right of the *Permissions* pane to close it and do the same for the *Settings* pane

# Exercise 4 – Manage access to an app

Our expenses library should not be visible to the visitors of our site like Simon. We have been asked to hide the whole library so that visitors are unable to see the library in the navigation or search results. This can be achieved by stopping inheritance of the sites security within the app, allowing us to remove the Site visitors group.

1. In your left navigation, click on **Site contents** and in the site contents menu, click **Expenses** (or if you added the link to the Expenses library into the quick launch, use it to access the Expenses library)

1. Click on the **Settings** ![Single gear outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-877.png) cog at the top-right of the page, and select **Library settings**
2. In the *Library settings* pane choose **More library settings**
3. Under the heading *Permissions and Management* click on the link for **Permissions for this document library**  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-891.png)
4. In the ribbon, click on the option, **Stop inheriting permissions**  

![A screenshot of a computer screen  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-892.png)
5. When asked to confirm, click **OK**  

![A grey background with white text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-893.png)

1. Although the library is no longer inheriting its security, the groups can still be populated with users at this level, which directly impacts the whole site, if anyone needs to be added as a user to just this library, it is best practice to use the Grant permissions button in the ribbon rather than opening any of the listed groups and adding the user there
2. To remove the visitors group from this library, place a tick next to the **[Site name] Visitors** group  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-894.png)
3. In the ribbon select **Remove User Permissions**  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-895.png)
4. Click **OK** to confirm
5. Now only the Members and Owners of this site can see the expenses library, note that to undo any changes in inheritance, the *Delete unique permissions* button can be used to reset the security for this app

# Exercise 5 – Restricting access to a folder

A member of your site, Caroline, has asked if a special folder can be set up for management. This folder should only be accessible to the team leaders Steve, Caroline and yourself. In this scenario you will create a folder and use modern group management to adjust the audience of the folder.

1. In the quick launch select the **Documents** library

1. Select **New** and choose **Folder**  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-896.png)
2. Name the folder **Private – Management Only** and click **Create**
3. Right-click on the folder and choose **Manage access**  
![A computer screen with a mouse pointer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-897.png)

1. In the *Manage access* menu, select the **Groups** tab  

![A screenshot of a computer screen  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-898.png)
2. At this point, note that the visitors and members groups both have access to the folder, to reduce this down click on the **Can view** option to the right of *[Site Name] – Visitors*  
![A black and white image of a number  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-899.png)
3. Expand the **Direct access** drop down and select **Can view**, then choose **Remove direct access** (this is the same as stop inheriting permissions in classic SharePoint AND removing the group at the same time)  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-900.png)
4. Confirm by clicking **Remove**
5. Repeat steps 6 to 8 to remove the *[Site Name] – Members* group
6. You will just be left with the owners groups which cannot be removed, this ensures that owners can always support all elements of their site, even ones with custom permissions  

![A screenshot of a phone  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-901.png)
7. To make sure that Caroline and Steve both have access to the folder, we will add them using the **Grant access** button at the top right of the menu  

![A close-up of a person's face  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-902.png)
8. Enter Caroline Lee and Steve smith into the To field  

![A screenshot of a chat  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-903.png)
9. Choose **Grant access**, this will email anyone who doesn’t currently have access, like Caroline
10. Close the confirmation dialog by clicking **X**
11. Right click on the folder again and choose **Manage access**
12. Notice that Steve Smith and Caroline Lee are both editors  

![A screenshot of a group  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-904.png)
13. You can select either Steve or Caroline and note you can still decrease their access to view or remove them, and clicking **<-** (back) at the top left of the screen will return you to the people tab
14. In classic SharePoint we had the option to delete unique permissions and inherit the security from the site, if we wish to do this we can click on the **…** more options button at the top-right of the menu and choose **Advanced settings**![A yellow arrow pointing to a white box with black text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-905.png)
15. We are taken to the classic SharePoint page for managing the permissions for the current folder, note the *Delete unique permissions* button here, which can be used to reset the security on the folder – note this would release sensitive data to site users so we will not do this
16. In the quick launch, select **Documents** to return to the library for the last exercise

# Exercise 6 – Share a folder

You are collaborating with members of another department. Within your site are a collection of documents you need to work on with Penny and Deborah from Marketing and Communications. There are too many files to share individually so you have decided to move the files into a single folder to share them. Both Penny and Deborah need to be able to view the files, and neither should be able to reshare the files with others.

1. In the documents library, use the **New** button and select **Folder**
2. Name the folder **Shared – MarComms Documents** and click **Create**
3. Position your mouse cursor over the folder to access the **Share** icon and click on it (alternatively right-click on the folder and choose **Share**)  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-906.png)
4. In the To: field enter Penny Coventry and Deborah Wong
5. To the right of the To field, click on the **Edit** icon and in the drop down change their access to **Can view**  

![A screenshot of a chat  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-907.png)
6. Notice that at the bottom of the menu the link will describe what access is being given, your organisation can set the default level of access given, in this case Penny and Deborah will get a link but note that the link is giving everyone in the organisation view access, so it can be forwarded onto others in our organisation and grant them view rights  

![A close-up of a review  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-908.png)
7. To correct this click on the **Settings** ![Single gear outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-877.png) cog at the top right of the menu  

![A black and white text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-909.png)

![A white background with black text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-910.png)
9. Note that the bottom of this menu houses an option to restrict viewers from downloading their own copies of the files, switch *Block download* to **On**  

![A white background with black lines  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-911.png)
10. At the bottom of this menu click **Apply**
11. Note that the message at the bottom of the sharing menu has been revised, to send the email with the link, click **Send**  

![A red rectangle with black text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-912.png)
12. Close the confirmation menu
13. Penny contacts you and mentioned their required access needs to be increased, as there are parts of the documents they need to collaborate on, often in this situation content owners either delete the link and try again or send another link without removing the former link, we can actually just amend the existing link
14. Right click on the *Shared – MarComms Documents* folder and choose **Manage access**
15. Select the **Links** tab  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-913.png)

# Lab 7 – Working with Search

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-687.png)

To help locate content that resides in apps across Microsoft 365 such as Microsoft Teams, SharePoint and OneDrive, you can use search. Search can be conducted very locally, inside an app such as a list or library. You can also conduct searches for information at the site level and even from all sites, depending on your level of access. As discussed, when searching for content, you will only see information that you have been given access to. If you do not have access to a site, its contents will not appear in your search. This is known as security trimming.

Your searches will also allow you to filter your content further so that many results can reduce to a handful in one or two clicks.

Modern search is always being improved, and we can expect more rich features as well as the ability to customise the way it works in the future.

Classic search can be accessed through legacy SharePoint links which will allow privileged users to make customisations. The enterprise search centre has been created as part of your Microsoft 365 tenant. Although at present this has been completely overridden by modern search.

When further customisations capabilities are added to the modern search interface, we will endeavour to improve this exercise with these techniques.

# Exercise 2 – Search a site and search all sites

Next we will conduct a larger search at the site level.

1. At the top of the screen, click on the search box  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image1202.png)
2. Next, type in the word **tech** and press **enter**
3. Because the search is focused on our current site, the results do not include the news article about our tech bar that was created in your communication site
4. You can conduct an ‘all sites’ search either from a local search clicking the **Organization** breadcrumb link at the top of the page  

![A screenshot of a phone  Description automatically generated with low confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-918.png)
5. Note that more content is being selected including content from your communication site  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-919.png)
6. Change the search to **Tech OR training** and press **Enter** on your keyboard (the OR needs to be upper case to be considered as an operator)
7. At the top of the screen click on the **Files** tab, then click on **File type**  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-920.png)

1. In the filters menu for files, select **Video** then **Apply**  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-921.png)
2. Because OneDrive is a part of SharePoint, you will be able to see the content that you uploaded to your OneDrive in your search results, in the result below is a video file we uploaded at the beginning of the course  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-922.png)
3. Click on the search result to play the video in the browser, note that your search is still open in a separate tab, allowing you to return to it if required.

# Exercise 3 – Optional: Create a search vertical

This is an optional exercise where we will show you how to create a custom search vertical in your site collection. A vertical is a tab at the top of the search results used to query specific content. By default, you have verticals for All, Files, Sites, and Images. We will create a new vertical for video files. You will need an additional 10 minutes to do this exercise.

1. Return to your SharePoint team site
2. Click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog and then select **Site information**
3. Click on **View all site contents**
4. On the site settings page, scroll to the bottom of the page and under the heading *Microsoft Search* click on **Configure search settings**  

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-679.png)
5. Select the **Verticals** tab

![Text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-923.png)

1. Next click on **+ Add**
2. Name the new vertical **Videos** and click **Next**
3. When asked to select a content source, select **SharePoint**, and click **Next**

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-924.png)  

1. In the KQL query box, we wish to filter by common video file types, to do this enter the following into the box or copy and paste the query  

*filetype:mp4 OR filetype:mov OR filetype:wmv OR filetype:mpeg OR filetype:mpg*  

![Text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-925.png)
2. Click **Next**, then on the filters page we can allow users to further filter the content, click on **+ Add a filter**
3. **Tick** the property named *Created*   

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image902.png)
4. Click **Next**, then to give the filter a more relevant name, enter **Video upload date** into the *Name* field
5. Under *Preferences* switch *User input box* to **On,** and then click **Add**
6. We could add more filters, but for now, lets continue by clicking **Next**
7. The next part is important, scroll to the bottom of the review page for your vertical, and ensure that you switch the *State* option to **Enabled**  
![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-926.png)
8. Lastly, click on **Create vertical** and once added, click **Done**, to speed up its activation, navigate to your team site add the following to the end of the URL in the address bar  
?cacheClear=true  

e.g. *https:/[tenant name].sharepoint.com/sites/[site name]?cacheClear=true*  
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-927.png)
9. Press **Enter**, then search for a keyword, for example *conference* to see the new vertical  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image1213.png)
10. As you are unlikely to have a lot of videos in your team site, below is an example of this vertical being used to focus on videos within a site with more video content

# Lab 8 – Enterprise Content Management

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-785.png)

The success of your SharePoint site is reaching other areas of the business. They have their own SharePoint sites and would like their own expense claim process. Rather than rebuild the library for each team and encourage them to keep using the most up to date expense claim template, you decide to band together with stakeholders to discuss a global expense claim.

The team have agreed on an up to date template as well as required properties that should be appended to each claim. This is to help keep track of the business processes around completing a claim.

To create a proof of concept for the stakeholders, you will create the content type in your site collection. In addition to this content type we will need a couple more columns that will be necessary for categorising expense documents.

Finally, to ensure that claims are not modified after they are approved, you will enable and test in place records management to lock a claim as a record. If your proof of concept is successful, it will be added to the content type gallery (in the SharePoint admin center) which allows it to be distributed to all site collections.

# Exercise 2 – Create site columns

Wherever our content type is used, we wish for it to carry specific metadata such as the claim status, and line manager. To achieve this, we will create and add two site columns to the expenses content type.

1. On the Expenses content type settings page, scroll down until you can see the *Site columns* area  

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-931.png)

1. Select **+ Add site column** > **Create new site column**
2. Using the **Create new site column** option, add the following columns and configure the settings where mentioned (settings that have a red line can be left as they are) then click **Save**:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setting | Column 1 | Column 2 |
| Name | Claim Status | Line Manager |
| Description |   |   |
| Category | Custom Columns | Custom Columns |
| Type | Choice | Person or Group |
| Bespoke Setting | A screenshot of a phone  Description automatically generated with low confidence |   |
| Default Value | Submitted |   |

1. Check that the columns now appear under the *Site columns* heading for the Expenses content type, then move your mouse cursor over the *Title* column and click on the **View actions** ellipsis(…) and select **Edit Site columns settings** (the option is also available above column headings)  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-933.png)
2. **Untick** the option *Show this column in lists*  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image-934.png)
3. Click **Save**
4. This content type will not ask for the title field to be completed when adding metadata

# Exercise 4 – Set up in place records

In our final exercise of this course, we will enable in place records management, allowing us to lock down files so that they can’t be edited or removed from the library once they become a record.

1. In your team site click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog then choose on **Site information** then **View all site settings**

1. Under the heading, *Site Collection Administration* click on **Site collection features**
2. Activate the feature named **In Place Records Management**
3. Once activated use the quick launch to access the **Monthly Claims** library
4. In the library, click on the **Settings** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55215/epub/images/image745.png) cog, choose **Library settings** and select **More library settings**
5. Under the heading, *Permissions and Management* click on **Record declaration settings**
6. From the selection choose **Always allow the manual declaration of records** and click **OK**
7. In the breadcrumb trail, click on **Monthly Claims** to return to the library
8. **Right-click** on the file and select **More**,then **Compliance details**
9. Click on **Declare as an in place record** choose **OK** when notified that it will lock the file down, the status of the record will show Processing request, then it will change to *Undeclare in place record*, click **Close**
10. The file will appear to be checked out (if it is not, try refreshing the web browser by pressing **F5** on the keyboard)
11. Place your mouse cursor on the file name and it will mention it is checked out to a system account
